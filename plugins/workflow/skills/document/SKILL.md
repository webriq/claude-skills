name: document
description: Update project documentation after feature approval. Creates/updates feature docs and user guides. Use after /test passes and user approves. Supports task IDs for easier invocation.
model: haiku
---

# /document - Documentation Agent

> **Model:** haiku (templated documentation work)

## When to Use

Invoke `/document {ID}` when:
- Task has passed testing (`/test` returned PASS)
- User has approved the implementation
- Ready to update project documentation

**Example:** `/document 1` or `/document 001-dashboard-redesign`

## Task ID Resolution

The `{ID}` can be:
- **Numeric ID:** `1`, `2`, `3` → Looks up in TASKS.md, finds matching task document
- **Padded ID:** `001`, `002` → Same as numeric
- **Full filename:** `001-dashboard-redesign` → Direct file reference

## Workflow

```
/document {ID}
       ↓
1. Resolve task ID → find task document
2. Read task document for context
3. Check Automation field (manual | auto)
4. Read test report for verification
5. Update/create feature documentation
6. Update/create user guide (if user-facing)
7. Update CLAUDE.md files if needed
8. Move task to "Approved" in TASKS.md
       ↓
┌─── Automation Mode? ───┐
│                        │
▼ Manual                 ▼ Auto
Notify user              Invoke /ship {ID}
Ready for /ship
```

## Auto Mode Behavior

When task document has `Automation: auto`:

After documentation is complete, use Task tool to spawn ship agent with **model: haiku**:
```
Documentation complete: #{ID} - {Task Title}

Updated files:
- docs/features/{feature}.md
- docs/guides/{feature}.md

[AUTO] Spawning /ship with haiku model...
```
`Task({ subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "haiku", prompt: "/ship {ID}" })`

## Pre-Documentation Checklist

### 1. Gather Context (Primary Sources Only)

Read these files — they contain all the context you need:
```
docs/task/{ID}-{task-name}.md        - Implementation details
docs/testing/{ID}-{task-name}.md     - Test results & verification
```

**IMPORTANT — Context Efficiency:**
These two documents were created by the `/task`, `/implement`, and `/test` agents which already analyzed the codebase. Do NOT perform broad codebase exploration. Only read specific source files if you need to verify implementation details for documentation accuracy.

### 2. Identify Documentation Needs

| Change Type | Documentation Needed |
|-------------|---------------------|
| New feature | Feature doc + User guide |
| Enhancement | Update existing docs |
| Bug fix | Update troubleshooting sections |
| API change | Update API reference |

### 3. Use Templates

Follow the templates defined in this document:
- **Feature Documentation Structure** - Technical feature docs (see below)
